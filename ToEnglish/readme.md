One common security method requires that the amount on a cheque be written in numbers and spelled out in words as well. Even if someone is able to alter the numerical amount of the check, it is extremely difficult to change the amount in words.
Write an application that asks the user to input a numeric check amount and writes the word equivalent of the amount. For example, the amount 112.43 should be written as ONE hundred TWELVE and 43/100. A sample run:
Please enter a dollar amount:

19.50
Dollar amount in words: NINETEEN and 50/100
